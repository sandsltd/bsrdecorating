## Brand Voice and Content Guidelines

> **Instructions for the SEO agent:** Follow these guidelines when generating any content for BSR Decorating.

### Tone
- Professional but approachable. Not stuffy.
- Expert knowledge demonstrated through specifics, not jargon.
- Local and personal — reference specific Exeter/Topsham streets, landmarks, and areas.
- Confident but not salesy. Let expertise sell itself.

### Business Details (Use Consistently)
- **Name:** BSR Decorating
- **Full name:** BSR Decorating (Saunders Simmons)
- **Location:** Based in Dawlish, Devon
- **Service area:** Exeter, Topsham, Dawlish, Newton Abbot, Torquay, Exmouth, Bovey Tracey
- **Experience:** 20+ years
- **Specialisms:** Domestic, commercial, heritage/period properties, kitchen spraying, eco-friendly paints
- **USPs:** Surfers Against Sewage partnership, eco-conscious, community-focused
- **Phone:** Available on website
- **Website:** https://www.bsrdecorating.co.uk

### Content Rules
1. **Always localise.** Reference Devon, Exeter, Topsham by name. Mention specific areas (St Leonard's, Pennsylvania, Heavitree) where relevant.
2. **Use real pricing data.** Reference the pricing table in the Market Context section above.
3. **Reference conservation areas and listed buildings.** This establishes heritage expertise and creates content competitors can't easily replicate.
4. **Include internal links.** Every blog post should link to at least 2 other pages on the site (service pages, area pages, or other blog posts).
5. **Include a call to action.** Every post should naturally mention getting a free quote.
6. **Word count:** 1,000-1,500 words. Comprehensive but not padded.
7. **Format:** Use subheadings (H2, H3), bullet points, and short paragraphs. Make it scannable.
8. **Avoid:** Generic advice that could apply anywhere. Every post should feel like it was written by someone who knows Exeter.

## Notes for Future Sessions

- **Exeter is a LOCAL SEO game.** Every piece of content must reference specific Devon locations, streets, and landmarks. Generic decorating advice won't rank.
- **Heritage is the biggest differentiator.** With 994 listed buildings and only 2 heritage-focused competitors (Isca, Lois Raine) who both have zero blog content, BSR can own this niche through content.
- **Kitchen spraying is the growth opportunity.** No local decorator ranks for it. National search volume is 300-800/mo. Create a content hub: service page + cost guide + FAQ + before/after gallery.
- **Topsham is almost won.** Page 2 → Page 1 is achievable with 2-3 more targeted blog posts and consistent internal linking.
- **Exeter will take longer.** Page 10 → Page 1 requires sustained content production, internal linking, and ideally some backlinks. Target 3-6 months.
- **Don't duplicate existing content.** Always check the "Already Published" list before generating a new post. If a topic overlaps, either skip it or write a distinctly different angle.
- **Seasonal timing matters.** Publish spring/exterior content in January-February. Publish autumn/interior content in July-August.
- **The BSR blog system is different from PaperRoute/SkipRoute.** Blog posts are stored in TypeScript data files (`/src/data/blogPosts.ts` and `/src/data/blogContent.ts`), NOT MDX files. The publish module must append to these files.
- **Conservation area enforcement is real.** A Topsham property owner was fined £38,000 in Dec 2025. This makes excellent content — it demonstrates why professional heritage decorating matters.
- **Full research reports** are saved at:
  - `/Users/nick/Documents/code/seo_dec_25/output/bsr-decorating-keyword-research.md`
  - `/Users/nick/Documents/code/seo_dec_25/output/bsr-decorating-market-research.md`
